To solve the issues with `calc()` and percentages, ensure that the percentage is calculated based on the desired context.

For the nested `div` example, one solution could be to calculate the width relative to the overall container:

```css
body {
  width: 100%; /* or define a width as needed */
}
div {
  width: 50%;
}
div div {
  width: calc(50% - 20px); /* Now calculates 20px from the 50% of parent*/
}
```

Alternatively, use absolute units or viewport units (vw, vh) instead of percentages in the `calc()` function if needed to avoid these calculation issues.

Always use correct spacing and parenthesis in the `calc` function to avoid order of operations errors.  Avoid relying on nested percentage values within calc function if possible.

For correct order of operations use parenthesis correctly: 
```css
div {
    width: calc(50% + (20px / 2)); /*Correct*/
    width: calc((50% + 20px) / 2); /*Correct */
}
```
